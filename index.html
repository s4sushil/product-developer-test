        <h1>Product developer test</h1>
        <p>This test is designed to provide a real-world scenario for you to autonomously complete to the best of your ability.</p>
        <p>You are to complete as much as you see fit to show us what you are capable of.</p>
        <p><strong>You are expected to spend around 2 - 4 hours on this test.</strong></p>
        <br/>

        <h2>The Scenario</h2>
        <p>We have a website were we would like to include a <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare integration</a> in the future, as part of this task you have been chosen to create a demo showing how we can integrate the API to show something useful.</p>
        <p>You are tasked with creating a page or application which allows you to search for a place by name and return the recommended or popular venues near that location.</p>
        <p>You are then free to display the results as you see fit.</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We think that this is easiest to complete using HTML/JS/CSS but <strong>you are able to use any language, platform, framework or libraries that you think is useful.</strong></li>
            <li>Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow and any other websites or tutorials for inspiration but ensure it is your own solution that you submit.</li>
            <li>You will need to sign up as a Foursquare developer and create an app in order to use their services.</li>
            <li><strong>We must be able to run your code.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Please submit your code by creating a repository on GitHub and providing us with the link to the repo.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>You must check in your code at least once every 30mins.</strong></li>
            <li>When you submit your code <strong>you must send a summary (or have it as your readme.md) explaining the approach you have taken.</strong></li>
        </ul>
